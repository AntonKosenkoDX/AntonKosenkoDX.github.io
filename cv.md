## About Me

Engineering Manager with 8 years of hands-on experience in software development (.NET) and 4 years in engineering leadership. I specialize in building high-performing teams from the ground up, elevated existing teams' performance, and driving large-scale organizational and technical changes aligned with company strategy.

My key strengths include a deep commitment to product quality, strong attention to detail, and the ability to navigate teams through complex and high-pressure environments. I’ve consistently helped teams not only survive challenges but emerge stronger and more effective.

I’m seeking opportunities to lead ambitious engineering teams, scale development processes, and deliver impactful technological solutions that drive real business value.
